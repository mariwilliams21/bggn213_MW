### Data Prep
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
df <- read.csv("qpcr practice - Sheet2.csv",row.names=1)
df$treatment <- c(rep("fent", 6), rep("saline", 5))
```


```{r}
gene_names <- c("GAPDH", "PGK1", "ENO1", "BNIP3", "Pdk1", "EPO", "SLC2a1", "HIF1a")
rep_names  <- rep(1:3, times = length(gene_names))
gene_labels <- rep(gene_names, each = 3)
new_names <- paste0(gene_labels, "_", rep_names)

colnames(df)[1:24] <- new_names
colnames(df)[25] <- "treatment"   # last column is treatment

df$sample_id <- seq_len(nrow(df))
head(df)
```
```{r}

df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = all_of(new_names),

  ) %>%

```
### Averaging and Computing delta CT
```{r}
# average the triplicates

# make a df with the GAPDH means
gapdh_means <- gene_means %>%
  filter(gene == "GAPDH") %>%
  select(sample_id, treatment, gapdh_mean = mean_CT)
gene_means
gapdh_means
```

```{r}
#add the gapdh mean for that mouse to the column, and then subtract it from the CT of each other gene 
dCT <- gene_means %>%
  left_join(gapdh_means, by = c("sample_id", "treatment")) %>%
  mutate(dCT = mean_CT - gapdh_mean) %>%
  filter(gene != "GAPDH")   

dCT_summary <- dCT %>%
  group_by(treatment, gene) %>%
  summarise(mean_dCT = mean(dCT, na.rm = TRUE),

```
